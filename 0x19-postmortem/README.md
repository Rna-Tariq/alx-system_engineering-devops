## Issue Summary
**Duration:**  
June 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM UTC

**Impact:**  
Our e-commerce platform went from being a well-oiled machine to a turtle in quicksand, with page load times increasing from an average of 1.2 seconds to over 15 seconds. Approximately 75% of users were affected, leading to a 60% drop in transactions during the outage period. User frustration levels hit an all-time high, resulting in numerous tweets featuring angry cat memes.

**Root Cause:**  
The culprit? An unoptimized database query that decided to take a scenic route, causing a sudden spike in CPU and memory usage on the primary database server.

## Timeline

![Incident Timeline](https://via.placeholder.com/600x150.png?text=Incident+Timeline)

- **10:00 AM UTC** - Issue detected via monitoring alert screaming "Database on fire!"
- **10:05 AM UTC** - On-call engineer confirmed the high CPU usage on the primary database server.
- **10:15 AM UTC** - Misleading debugging path: suspected DDoS attack, potentially from angry ex-database admins.
- **10:30 AM UTC** - Network team engaged to investigate potential DDoS attack; no such luck.
- **10:45 AM UTC** - Realized traffic was normal; focus shifted back to the database.
- **11:00 AM UTC** - Database team identified a slow-running query that looked like it was written by a sleep-deprived raccoon.
- **11:15 AM UTC** - Escalated to development team responsible for the latest deployment.
- **11:30 AM UTC** - Code rollback initiated to previous stable version.
- **12:00 PM UTC** - Rollback completed; database performance began to stabilize.
- **12:30 PM UTC** - Monitoring confirmed that system performance returned to normal. Whew!

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by an unoptimized database query introduced during a code deployment the previous night. The query involved multiple complex joins and lacked proper indexing, causing the database server to behave like it was juggling flaming swords.

**Resolution:**  
The incident was resolved by rolling back the deployment to the previous stable version of the application. This rollback removed the problematic query, allowing the database performance to return to normal. After the incident, we optimized the query by adding appropriate indexes and simplifying the join operations, making the query faster than a caffeine-fueled cheetah.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Enhance code review process to include database query optimization checks.
- Implement additional monitoring to detect and alert on slow queries.
- Improve deployment procedures to include performance testing for database queries.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Database Server:** Update database indexing and optimize existing queries.
2. **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for slow queries and high CPU usage on the database server.
3. **Review Code Deployment Procedures:** Ensure performance testing for database queries is part of the deployment pipeline.
4. **Training:** Conduct training sessions for developers on writing optimized database queries.
5. **Create Incident Response Playbook:** Develop a detailed incident response plan for database performance issues.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure a more robust and reliable e-commerce platform. And remember, no more queries written by raccoons!
